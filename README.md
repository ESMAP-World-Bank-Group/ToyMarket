# About

This project aims to explore electricity market outcomes under different market designs, particularly when there is potential for market power to be exercised. The model allows users to analyze how market structures and regulatory mechanisms influence dispatch decisions and market prices.

# Current Scope
The model currently includes:

- Dispatch modeling: Simulating the short-term operation of electricity markets under different conditions.
- No capacity investment: The model does not yet include investment decisions for new generation capacity.

## Market design

Users can test the impact of different market designs, including but not limited to:

- Level of vesting contracts: Assessing how forward contracts can mitigate market power.
- Unbundling: Analyzing the effect of separating generation and transmission assets on market competition.
